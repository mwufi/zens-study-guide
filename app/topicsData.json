                "question": "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
                "response": "Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find patterns or structures."

                "id": "FML002",
                "question": "Explain the bias-variance tradeoff.",
                "response": "The bias-variance tradeoff is the balance between a model's ability to fit the training data (low bias) and its ability to generalize to new data (low variance). High bias leads to underfitting, while high variance leads to overfitting."
            },
